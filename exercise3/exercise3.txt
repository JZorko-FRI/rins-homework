# Exercise 3: The Turtlebot

# GAZEBO simulator:
# .dae = 3d model + graphics to be included in the model
# .world = model/recipe which Gazebo actually loads

# Start a complete simulation of the Turtlebot robot in Gazebo
$ roslaunch exercise3 rins_world.launch

# Start a Rviz visualizer
$ rviz
$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch
$ rostopic info /scan
$ rostopic echo /scan

# Control the robot with the keyboard
$ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch

# 1. Map-building
$ roslaunch exercise3 gmapping_simulation.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch 
$ roslaunch turtlebot_teleop keyboard_teleop.launch
# Build a map and export it (.yaml + .pgm)
$ rosrun map_server map_saver -f [the_name_of_your_map]

# 2. Navigation
# Start the simulation 
$ roslaunch exercise3 rins_world.launch
# Start the navigation (amcl = Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization)
$ roslaunch exercise3 amcl_simulation.launch
$ roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_navigation.launch
